# BreadApp
An application to manage your home bread baking

This app helps to compare results of home bread baking
enabling to store and compare data about breads such as
- flours used,
- amount of water,
- baking time,
- proofing time. 

Due to time constrains (app was made as a final project for a programming bootcamp)
the application assumes that bread is made on sourdough using a certain recipe framework:
 
- preparing a leavening starter from sourdough, water and flour first,
- mixing starter with flours, salt and water
- one or two proofing times with kneading before each
- kneading time or technique is not taken into account as it is hard to measure because
it's quality depends strongly on one's skills
- baking
